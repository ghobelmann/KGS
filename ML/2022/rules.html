		    <h2>Scoring and Format</h2> 
		  <p>Each week you will play another player according to the schedule.  We will be using the match play format, where each hole is worth
		  2 points, if you win the hole you get 2 points, if you tie the hole you each get 1 point and if you lose the hole you get 0 points. 
		  The player with the lowest Net score (subracting your handicap from what you really shot) will also get 4 points.  
		  If there is a tie on net score each player recieves 2 points.
		  There is a total of 22 points (2 points per 9 holes = 18 + 4 for low net) possible per match. 
		   4 matches per team, so each night there is a possible 88 points per match, times 6 team matchups for a
		  grand nightly total of 528.  (Unless somebody has to play the course)
		  We will keep track of your handicap and it will be updated each week.</p><p>  To figure points using handicaps, 
		  let's say for example your handicap is a 7 and your opponant is a 5, you have to give your opponant and extra stroke on the 2 hardest handicap holes,
		   keep in mind handicap holes are different from white and blue tees.  If you are a 9 and your opponant is an 18, you have to give him a stroke on all
		   9 holes.  Then if you shoot a 45 with a handicap of 7, you shot a net 38.  If your opponant is an 18 and shot a 58, he has a net score of 40.  
		   So you won the low net and get the extra 4 points.  Handicaps are on your scorecards with the handicap holes from 1 to 9 with 1 being the hardest
		   and 9 being the easiest hole.  Then add up your points, 2 for a win, and 1 for a tie plus the four points for low net, and that is your score.  Piece of cake!!

		<p>11. We will play 3 weeks off of last years handicap before moving to this years.  If you don't have a handicap you play at 80 % each night for 3 weeks at which time your current avg of those 3 scores will be used.</p>
		<p>12. For makeup matches you have to play the person, you can not each play a round on different days then figure the score.</p>
		<p>13. 88 points possible for each team on match play nights. 26 points possible on scramble nights.(2 grougs, AB-CD, 13 for first, 12 for 2nd etc.)</p>
		<p>14. Each Team will play every night.</p>

		<p>16. Scores and schedules can be found at www.usd237.com/golf</p>
		<p>17. To figure scores, </p>
		<p>a. Take the difference of the handicaps, (Player A has a 10, Player be is a 7)</p>
		<p>b. Player A gets 3 strokes on the 3 hardest holes that night. (Blue and White tees have different HC holes), on the scorecards the handicaps are shown by numbers, 1 is the hardest, 9 is the easiest.</p>
		<p>c. If a hole is tied- Each player gets 1 point per hole.</p>
		<p>d. Which ever player has the least strokes, (after figuring in handicap) gets 2 points per hole.</p>
		<p>e. After nine holes, who ever has the lowest net score gets 4 points, 2 points each if tied.</p>
		<p>f. 2 points per hole, times 9 holes is 18 points.  4 points for lowest net is 22 points per match.</p>
		<p>g. 4 matches per team times 22 points is 88 points possible per night.</p>
		<p>f. With 12 teams playing each other, that makes 6 matchups at 88 points per night is 528 points per night.</p>
